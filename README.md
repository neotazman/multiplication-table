# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Multiplication Table

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan

1. create a function to do the calculations
2. create component to place the boxes
3. create a functions to create a table from the rows
4. create inputs for the user to create their own table
5. create the outer column and row to represent the factors of the table
6. highlight the row and column that the mouse is hovering over

## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

i did consider using vanilla javascript, but i though react would be better to create a custom table and if i had to convert vanilla to react, that would be harder than just writing the whole thing in react to begin with
