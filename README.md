Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan

2. create component to place the boxes
